# ETH Boss Hunter â€” Backlog

How to use:
- Move items between sections (Backlog â†’ In Progress â†’ Done).
- Use checkboxes; link PRs/issues when available.
- Keep decisions and links updated.

## MVP â€” Definition of Done
- Deployed to Vercel.
- Page shows sorted daily candle tops (since 2021-01) with date, price, and progress bars.
- Live price polled every ~10â€“15s via serverless endpoint with fallback providers and basic caching.
- Basic error handling and formatting.

## In Progress
- [ ] Improve boss card design, each should have a HP (target price minus previos boss price), Tier (based on age), Number, spawn date
- [ ] **Real-time Notifications** - Alert when bosses are defeated
- [ ] **Share Cards Improvements** - Add share card to each boss, they will each need their own url, but also one each for defeated, active and hiding states so that cards are up-to-date when they are shared. Sharing the home page should share the current boss. Remove price and progress from these cards as they change too often.
