# ETH Boss Hunter - Battle Mechanics & Social Strategy

## 🎯 Core Battle Mechanics

### Boss Progression System
- **18 Weekly Boss Levels** ($4,006 → $4,868)
- **Progressive Difficulty** - Each boss's hit points are based on the price between the last boss and its own price
- **Battle States**: Approaching, In Battle, Defeated, Legendary (All-Time High)

### Current Battle Logic
```
Current Boss = Lowest undefeated boss level
Battle Progress = (Current Price - Previous Boss) / (Target Boss - Previous Boss)
Boss Status = Defeated when Current Price ≥ Boss Price
```

## 🐦 Twitter Posting Strategy

### 1. **Daily Boss Status** (1 tweet/day at 9 AM EST)
**Purpose**: Consistent engagement, daily community check-ins

**Template**:
```
